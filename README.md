This github is used by Álvaro Serrano to present the resolution of the ProgrammingProject Homework.














# Molecular Dynamics Directory

This directory contains all the relevant files for project 3.

Project 3 consists on the creation of a C code which purpose is to illustrate key concepts in MD simulations.

**A breakdown of each file can be found below.**

- **INSTALL.md:** The purpose of this file is to bring clear instructions on how to compile and run the program. In addition a short explanation of how to use github will be given as well.

- **Dynamics.pdf:** This is the file from where the instructions of how to make the Molecular Dynamic code have been followed. In it we can find all the formulas and algorithm used.

- **Inputs directory:** This directory is used to store all the input used to test the code. It it we can find the original Ar input as well as other ones.

- **Tests directory:** This directory is used to store all the trajectories calculated with the code. The purpose of each trajectory is to later on use it on an external software to visualize the dynamic.

- **SRC directory:** This directory is used to store all the relevant source files of the program. The C code can be found inside this directory.

- **Authors.md:** In this file, all the collaborators that have worked on the code can be found.


# Code Explanation

This section is used to explain the key features of the code.


**Below a breakdown of the code can be found.**

## -Reading in the input-
The first thing to do for our program to work is to read in the number of atoms, coordinates and mass for the specific molecule (input). The corresponding lines that perform these actions can be found next.
